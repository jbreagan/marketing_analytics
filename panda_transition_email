### About The Test

Goal: Transition Panda users to SpotHero platform via email and provide incentives to drive incremental purchases

Details

* On 3/5/2020, an email was sent to all addressable Panda users - about 350k users. Of those 350k users, only 50k had made a SpotHero purchase prior to the email send

* The 350k users were split into three groups using the modprime method and each group received a different version of the email
  + Control with no incentive
  + 15% off incentive
  + 20% off incentive
  + *see below for send count by email campaign*

*Note* - COVID-19 likely impacted the results but hard to say if things would've been different otherwise

```{r sent_emails, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
email_count = panda_transition_raw %>%
                group_by(campaign) %>%
                summarize(count_emails_sent = n())
knitr::kable(email_count, format = "markdown", align = 'c')
```

### Analyzing The Test

After one month, we revisited the three different campaigns to assess performance.

* While there was a slight lift in rentals per email send for the two campaigns with an incentive, the overall results were essentially the same. No statistical difference between any of the groups

```{r summary_stats, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
panda_transition_total$`Panda Transition Test Campaign` = as.factor(panda_transition_total$`Panda Transition Test Campaign`)

panda_transition_rename = panda_transition_total %>%
  rename(rental_count = `Rental Rental Count`,
         campaign = `Panda Transition Test Campaign`)

panda_transition_rename$`Rental Total Gross Revenue` = as.numeric(str_remove_all(panda_transition_rename$`Rental Total Gross Revenue`, "[$,]"))

total_summary_stats = panda_transition_rename %>%
  group_by(campaign) %>%
  summarize(rental_sum = n(),
            GMV_sum = dollar(sum(`Rental Total Gross Revenue`)),
            avg_rentals = round(mean(rental_count),digits = 2),
            avg_gmv = dollar(mean(`Rental Total Gross Revenue`)))

total_summary_with_sends = total_summary_stats %>%
  mutate(sends = case_when(
    campaign == 'control' ~ '114,687',
    campaign == 'testpromo15' ~ '115,137',
    campaign == 'testpromo20' ~ '114,521'
  ))

knitr::kable(total_summary_with_sends, format = "markdown", align = 'c')
```

* Only noticable SpotHero rental lift came on the day of the email send

* Interestingly, the *control* and *testpromo15* campaign groups increased ~60% day-over-day on the day of the send, but the *testpromo20* group only increased ~20%


```{r plot_1, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=9}
ggplot(panda_transition_daily_rentals, aes(x=date, y=rentals, color=campaign)) + geom_line(size=1) + geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(panda_transition_daily_rentals$date[43]),  linetype = "dashed", size=0.5) + ggtitle("SpotHero Rentals by Campaign")
```

* Panda rentals appeared to be uneffected by the email

```{r plot_2, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=9}
ggplot(panda_only_transition_daily_rentals, aes(x=date, y=rentals, color=campaign)) + geom_line(size=1) + geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(panda_transition_daily_rentals$date[43]),  linetype = "dashed", size=0.5) + ggtitle("Panda Rentals by Campaign")
```

* Of the 300k potential new SpotHero users, only 456 made their first SpotHero rental within a week of the email. 

* The campaign group *testpromo20* drove the most new users within that time period (166 new users), and that same group also had the highest pecentage of repeat purchases in the following month (20%). 

| Campaign        | New Rentals | Repeat Rentals | Repeat Purchase Percentaage |
|:---------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:---------------------------:|
|   control       |  144        |   18      |   12.5%        |
|   testpromo15   |  123        |   14      |    9.6%        |
|   testpromo20   |  166        |   33      |   19.9%        |



* Below is a summary of each campaign group's SpotHero performance in the month following the email send. Results of an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test show that there is not a statiscally signicant difference between the groups. 

```{r anova, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

res.aov = aov(rental_count ~ campaign, data = panda_transition_rename)
tukey_summary = (TukeyHSD(res.aov))
tukey_df = as.data.frame(tukey_summary$campaign)
tukey_df = tukey_df %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column() %>%
  mutate(statistical_difference = case_when(
    `p adj` < 0.05 ~ 'Yes',
    `p adj` >= 0.05 ~ 'No'
  ))

knitr::kable(tukey_df, format = "markdown", align = 'c')
```

### Summary

* As previously mentioned, the goal of this test was to drive Panda Users to the SpotHero platform, and while there was a small uptick in SpotHero purchases on the day of the email, the increase was not sustained. 

* Less than 1% of potential new SpotHero users ended up making a purchase on the SpotHero platform within a week of the email.

* There was no significant difference between campaign groups in terms of overall rental performance

* Ultimately, we can conclude that email is not an effective tool for transitioning Panda users to become long-term SpotHero users
